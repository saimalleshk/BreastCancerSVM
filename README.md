# Case Study: Breast Cancer Classification

### K. Sai Mallesh

## Step-1: Problem Statement

-  Predictingk if the cancer diagnosis is **benign** or **malignant** based on several observations/features.

-  30 features are used, examples:

    -  radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

    -  texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

    -  perimeter

    -  area

    -  smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

    -  compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

    -  concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

    -  concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

    -  symmetry

    -  fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
  
-  Number of instances: 569

-  Number of attributes: 32(ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)

-  Attribute information

    -  ID number
    
    -  Diagnosis(M= Malignant, B=Benign)

## The Complete Analysis will be carried in 6 steps:

1) Defining Problem
2) Importing Data
3) Data Visualization
4) Data Training 
5) Data Evaluation
6) Model Improvement

## Conclusion:
-  **Machine learning techniques(SVM) was able to classify tumors into Malignant and Benign with 97% accuracy.**

-  **The Technique can rapidly evaluate cancer detections and classify them in an automated fashion.**

-  **With this an early study can be conducted and can be cured many patients.**

-  **This technique can be further improved by combining Computer Vision with ML to directly classify cancer using tissue images, which can be done through Neural Networks.**
